Step 2: Configure the Backend
After cloning the repository and navigating into the root directory (Tripzo), you need to install the server-side dependencies and set up the environment variables.

2.1 Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate into the backend directory and install all required Node.js packages.

Bash

# 3. Navigate into the backend directory
cd BackendTripzo

# 4. Install all backend dependencies (Node.js packages like express, mongoose, bcryptjs, etc.)
npm install
2.2 Set Up Environment Variables
Create a configuration file to store your sensitive keys and credentials.

Create .env file: In the root of the BackendTripzo/ directory, create a new file named .env.

Add Configuration: Paste the following structure into the .env file and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

Environment Variables for .env File

Server & Database

PORT: The port the backend server will run on (e.g., 5000).

MONGODB_URI: Connection string for your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

JWT_SECRET: A long, complex string for signing JSON Web Tokens.

API Keys

GEMINI_API_KEY: Your API key for the Gemini-powered AI Assistant.

OPENWEATHER_API_KEY: API key for weather lookups.

MAPQUEST_API_KEY: API key for distance calculations.

Email Service (Nodemailer)

EMAIL_USER: The email address for sending OTPs (e.g., your Gmail).

EMAIL_PASS: The application-specific password for the email account.

Bash

# .env file content structure (inside BackendTripzo/)
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI="<YOUR_MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING>"
JWT_SECRET="<YOUR_LONG_AND_COMPLEX_SECRET_KEY>"

GEMINI_API_KEY="<YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY>"
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="<YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY>"
MAPQUEST_API_KEY="<YOUR_MAPQUEST_API_KEY>"

EMAIL_USER="<YOUR_GMAIL_ADDRESS>"
EMAIL_PASS="<YOUR_GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>"
Step 3: Run the Backend Server
Start the Node.js server to handle API requests and database interactions.

Bash

# 5. Start the backend server (ensure you are still in the BackendTripzo/ directory)
npm start

# Success: You should see a console message confirming the server is running and connected to MongoDB.
Step 4: Run the Frontend Application
The frontend is a static application, which you can run using the recommended Live Server VS Code extension.

Open the Frontend Folder: In VS Code, navigate to the FrontendTripzo/ directory.

Launch index.html: Right-click on the main entry file, index.html, and select "Open with Live Server".

Access the Application: Your default web browser will open a new tab, and the Tripzo application will be ready for use! üöÄ
